  "definition": "Anterograde tracing is a technique used to trace axonal projections from their source (the cell body or soma) to their point of termination (the synapse).",
  "description": "Anterograde tracers are taken up by neuronal cell bodies at the injection site and travel to the axon terminals. Anterograde tracing techniques allow for a detailed assessment of neuronal connections between a target population of neurons and their outputs throughout the nervous system.",
