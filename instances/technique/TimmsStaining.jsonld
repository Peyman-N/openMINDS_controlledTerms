  "definition": "A technique used to selectively visualize a variety of metals (e.g. zinc, copper, iron) in biological tissue based on sulphide-precipitation of metals in the tissue.",
  "description": "The principle of this technique is that metals in the tissue can be transformed histochemically to metal sulphide. Subsequently, metal sulphide catalyze the reduction of silver ions by a reducing agent to metallic grains that are visible under a light or electron microscope.",
