  "definition": "'Cell-attached patch clamp' is an intracellular electrophysiology technique that fully preserves the intracellular integrity by forming a megaohm or gigaohm seal, leaving the cell membrane intact.",
  "description": "Cell-attached patch clamp is a patch clamp recording technique used in electrophysiology in which the intracellular integrity of the cell is preserved. Patches are formed using either a ‘loose seal’ (mega ohm resistance) or a ‘tight seal’ (giga ohm resistance) without rupturing the cell membrane. A loose seal is used for recording action potential currents, whereas a tight seal is required for evoking action potentials in the attached cell and for recording resting and synaptic potentials.",
