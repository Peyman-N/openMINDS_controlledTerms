  "definition": "In magnetic resonance imaging, a 'gradient-echo pulse sequence' is a rapid contrasting technique measuring if the magnetization in a motionless sample is coherent regardless of its position within the sample along at least one direction (cf. [Hargreaves (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1002/jmri.23742)].",
