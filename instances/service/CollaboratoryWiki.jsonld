  "description": "The Wiki service of the Collaboratory hosts the main interface to access all the other Collaboratory services. As such, it embodies the full concept of collab workspaces and most users consider it to be the collab service. Wiki pages are a convenient way of publishing content on the web, either addressing the Team of the collab or making the content completely public, that is, also accessible to visitors who do not have an EBRAINS account.",
